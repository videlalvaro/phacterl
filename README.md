# Phacterl #

Implementation of The Actor Model in PHP.

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/videlalvaro/phacterl/master/actors.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/videlalvaro/phacterl/master/actors.gif)

## Installation ##

Add `"videlalvaro/phacterl": "dev-master"` to your `composer.json` `require` section.

## Usage ##

Your _Actors_ need to extend the abstract class Actor for example, and
implement two methods: `Actor::init` and `Actor::receive`. For
example:

```php
class Counter extends Actor {
    public function init($args) {
        return array(
            'count' => 0
        );
    }

    public function receive() {
        return array('incr', 'get_count');
    }
}
```

The method init should return an array that would be the _State_ of the process. The runtime system will take care of managing the process state.

The method `receive` should return an array with strings specifying to which _message tags_ this process responds to.

In our case, the process `Counter` should also provide a method called `handle_incr` and another one called `handle_get_count`.

### Implementing the Handlers ###

A handler is a function that takes two parameters, a `Message` and the process `State` and returns a new state, like this:

```
class Counter extends Actor {
// snip

    public function handle_incr($msg, $state) {
        $state['counter'] += $msg['amount'];
        return $state;
    }

// snip
}
```

### Sending messages ###

To send a message, your actor can call the function `Actor::send`,
which expects a _process id_ and a `Message`. When creating a
`Message` instance, you need to provide a `tag`, like `'count'` in
this case, and the message data. The _tag_ is used to dispatch to a
message handler called `handle_<tag>`.

```php
class Counter extends Actor {
// snip

    public function handle_get_count($msg, $state) {
        $pid = $msg['sender'];
        $this->send(
                $pid,
                new Message(
                    'count',
                    array('sender' => $this->self(), 'count' => $state['counter'])
                )
            );
        return $state;
    }

// snip
}
```

Then, once you to run your actors, first get an instance of the `Scheduler`, and _spawn_ your actor, by passing in the class name and the initial parameters for the Actor's _init_ function.

```php
$scheduler = new Scheduler();
$pid = $scheduler->spawn('Counter', array());
$scheduler->run();
```

## Examples ##

On the demo folder you can find many examples which are
implementations of the algorithms presented in the book
[Distributed Algorithms for Message-Passing Systems](http://www.amazon.com/Distributed-Algorithms-Message-Passing-Systems-Michel/dp/3642381227/).

## Why? ##

Because implementing these algorithms in Erlang would be too easy.

Also, why not:
